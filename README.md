A code poem I wrote for my Printmaking Capstone


Written in javascript.

This code doesn't accomplish anything, but it does compile successfully.

The poem is about catching yourself striving for the perfect by sacrificing the good, and finding that the "good" is actually better than that dumb version of perfection in your head anyway.

This was originally written in 2012 for a senior capstone project for my art major.
